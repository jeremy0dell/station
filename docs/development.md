# Development

Status: current living doc for development, test, and documentation workflow.

## Environment

- Use Node.js 24.x and pnpm 11. The root `package.json` pins `node: 24.x`, `pnpm: 11.0.0`, and `packageManager: pnpm@11.0.0`.
- Use the repo-local command during development: `pnpm stn ...`.
- Use `pnpm station:link` only when you intentionally want the current checkout linked as the global `stn`.
- External tools are optional unless the lane needs them: Worktrunk for real worktree workflows, tmux for the reference terminal provider, and Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Pi, or OpenCode for real harness workflows.

## Local TUI Workflow

| Need | Command | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal run | `pnpm stn` / `pnpm stn tui` | Built CLI, configured observer |
| UI hot reload against the selected observer | `pnpm station:ui-dev` | Bun renderer only |
| CLI/package-output watcher | `pnpm dev` / `pnpm station:tui-dev` | Isolated by default, not Bun HMR |
| Isolated Station sandbox | `pnpm station:devbox` | Isolated observer, host, state, and supported hooks |
| Isolated Station sandbox with UI HMR | `pnpm station:devbox dev` | Same devbox isolation, Bun renderer hot reload |

Do not use `station:dev` as a catch-all name until it truthfully owns the UI,
CLI/package, observer, provider, protocol, and host restart boundaries.

- `pnpm stn` opens the normal station popup from the current checkout's built CLI when run inside tmux.
- `pnpm stn tui` opens the normal station TUI fullscreen from the current checkout's built CLI.
- Normal tmux popup fast-path registrations are scoped to the checkout root that created them. A popup launcher from another checkout ignores and clears stale normal popup metadata before falling back to that checkout's CLI.
- `pnpm station:ui-dev` starts the Bun renderer with hot reload for `station/src/**` UI changes from the current checkout.
- `pnpm station:tui-dev` starts the CLI-side dev TUI for the checkout where it is run. It watches the built Node CLI/package outputs, not the Bun renderer source. By default it uses a generated worktree-local config at `.dev-state/tui-dev/config.toml`, with observer `state_dir` and supported harness hook homes under `.dev-state` and a short checkout-keyed socket path under the OS temp dir so Unix socket names do not overflow on long worktree roots. It preconfigures isolated Codex, Claude, Cursor, and OpenCode hooks for that observer. Pass `--config <path>` or set `STATION_CONFIG_PATH` when you intentionally want a specific observer/config. While that process is alive, popup routing can reuse that dev UI only from the same checkout root. If another checkout already owns the dev popup, the command shows that root/session and asks whether to stop it before starting here.
- `pnpm station:devbox dev` starts the isolated Station sandbox with Bun hot reload for `station/src/**`; use it when UI iteration should not connect to the real observer.
- `pnpm station:reset` clears station tmux popup registrations for the current checkout and opens station normally from built code. Inside tmux that means a fresh popup; outside tmux that means the fullscreen TUI.
- `pnpm station:reset:tmux-tui` is the heavier tmux TUI refresh for this checkout. It requires clean `main`, pulls `origin/main`, clears only station TUI/popup tmux state, rebuilds, restarts the observer, then opens station from the rebuilt checkout. It does not kill worktree sessions or harness agents.

## Deterministic Gates

The deterministic local gate is:

```bash
pnpm test:all
```

It runs build, typecheck, lint, unit tests, contract tests, integration tests, diagnostics tests, and the scripted-agent lane. It intentionally excludes real provider lanes.

Useful focused commands:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:contracts
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:diagnostics
pnpm test:agent:scripted
pnpm smoke:release
```

For CI install parity, use:

```bash
CI=true pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
pnpm test:all
```

## Real And E2E Lanes

Real provider and broader e2e lanes are opt-in:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:e2e:real
pnpm test:e2e:worktrunk:real
pnpm test:e2e:claude:real
pnpm test:e2e:codex:real
pnpm test:e2e:cursor:real
pnpm test:e2e:pi:real
pnpm test:e2e:opencode:real
pnpm test:e2e:real:local
pnpm test:e2e:real:codex-hooks
```

Use `pnpm setup:system:check` before real lanes. Real lanes may require `STATION_REAL_*` flags, installed provider CLIs, credentials, tmux, model access, and isolated temporary projects. They must not become required for ordinary PR or `main` CI.

## Implementation Discipline

- For meaningful behavior changes, work red-first: write or update focused tests, observe the expected failure or characterize current behavior, implement, and keep the relevant gate green.
- Keep slices narrow. Prefer one contract, provider, observer, TUI, or diagnostics change at a time unless the behavior requires a vertical path.
- Current code, tests, runtime traces, and deterministic fixtures are stronger evidence than historical plans.
- Do not introduce production behavior through docs-only changes.

## TUI Work

TUI work has additional OpenTUI/React and terminal-layout expectations. The terminal UI is the OpenTUI renderer in `station/` (package `@station/workspace`, built on `@opentui/core` + `@opentui/react` + `react`). Use [TUI development](tui.md) before changing `station/` components, hooks, sources, keymaps, selectors, popup behavior, or renderer tests.

## TypeScript And Data Rules

- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is intentional. Preserve the difference between an absent optional field and a field set to `undefined`.
- For complex mappers, persistence row conversion, diagnostics construction, error shaping, and provider payload parsing, prefer typed local builders with explicit `if` assignments.
- Small conditional spreads are acceptable when local and obvious.
- Do not use `...(await somePromise)` in production array or object construction. Await into a named local first.
- Use strict schemas for untrusted input and shared payload formats. Avoid parallel hand-written validators for the same shape.
- Treat `unknown` as a boundary-only type. Parse JSON, TOML, CLI output, hooks, and provider payloads once with a strict Zod schema or contract parser, then pass typed values inward.
- Do not write little JavaScript-style type helper clusters such as `isRecord`, `asRecord`, `stringField`, `numberField`, or repeated `"key" in value` / `typeof value.foo === ...` checks when a shape already has, or should have, a schema or discriminated TypeScript type.
- If a payload shape is shared, define it in `packages/contracts` and infer the TypeScript type from the schema. If it is provider-private, keep the schema local to the provider adapter/parser.
- Inside already-typed code, use discriminated unions, exhaustive `switch` statements, typed builders, and inferred schema types instead of runtime property probing.
- Runtime shape probing is acceptable for generic recursion, redaction, error normalization, or the first step before schema parsing; keep it small, local, and avoid duplicating a schema.
- Provider-specific diagnostics and behavior must stay behind provider or integration boundaries.
- Do not move raw provider payloads into contracts, normal TUI rendering, protocol-facing shapes, or observer core logic.
- Do not make observer/core scrape provider-specific keys from generic `providerData`. Normalize those values at the provider boundary into contract fields, correlation fields, or provider-owned schema data.

## Agent Guidance Maintenance

- Keep always-loaded guidance concise. `AGENTS.md` should route agents and preserve hard repo quirks, not duplicate long plans.
- Use just-in-time references. Put detailed architecture, development, and debugging guidance in living docs that agents open only for relevant tasks.
- Scope guidance by task and path when possible. A terminal-boundary rule, docs workflow, or runtime-debug procedure should not force every agent to read an old rebuild plan.
- Review instructions periodically. Remove stale mandates, classify historical docs clearly, and update living docs when current code/tests prove a different truth.
- Avoid conflicting instructions. If an old plan, current doc, current test, and runtime evidence disagree, resolve the conflict explicitly instead of adding another overlapping rule.
